  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Functions are an important part of everyday life. They are used in computers, phones, cars, and everyday physics, where the properties of functions are essential to their performance and operations. Could you imagine what would happen if you pressed on the gas pedal of a car and the window wipers turned on, instead of moving? Or if you pressed the brakes and the radio went on and the car didn't slow? Functions ensure that when there is one instruction or input given, there is only one result. </p>
  <h1>Properties of Functions</h1>
  <p>Relations are a description of how two variables are related to each other. This relationship can be described in terms of a relation mapping diagram, a set of ordered pairs, a graph, or as words. Relations are covered in more detail in Functions 11, and won't be covered in Advanced Functions, however, it is still important to recognize the difference between the two terms. </p>
  <p>Functions are a special type of relation, where there is only one output of an independent variable. To determine whether oro not a relation is a function, if it is in graphical form it should pass the vertical line test, and if it is in set notation or mapping notation, each indepdendent variable, x, should only appear once in the set.</p>

    </span> graphs. Each of the graphs have their own properties, equations to solve, transformations, and application questions. </p>
    <p>Functions are usually written as f(x), but they can also be written as g(x), C(x), R(x), h(t), P(x), or any other combination of letters. The similarity between these methods of writing functions is that they all represent the value of the dependent variable, or the result, that is always displayed on the y-axis (vertical line) of a graph. Whatever letter is inside the bracket is the independent variable, or the x-axis (horizontal line) of the graph. The reason why the function letter changes is for descriptive purposes and because you can't use the same letters to represent different things. Generic functions use f(x), but for functions that describe the revenue of a business it might be R(x). Similarly, if a function describes the height of a ball over time, h(t) might be used.</p>

        <h2>Profit Example</h2>
      <img src="images/graph images/ProfitExample.png" class="ftimg">
      <h5 class="ftcaption">This is an example of Profit versus units sold. The y-axis is the profit, and the x-axis is the number of units sold, in thousands. Typically the profit of a business starts off being negative - there are costs that the business needs to cover, and without selling any products, it will make a loss (have a negative profit).<h5>
